LED Display Status
-------------------
Suite of tools which allows to:
- retrieve information (via the Novastar serial protocol 1.9.3 over USB) from Novastar sender cards and receiver cards which are connected to them
- manually control display parameters via Novastar sender cards
- automatically control display parameters via Novastar sender cards with a state machine and systemctl timers and services
- log all activity
- determine a displays operating status or health by smartly analysing information retrieved from the sender card(s)
- integration with other monitoring agents (Icinga) and Network Mangagement Systems

USAGE:
Windows: python display_status.py & echo %errorlevel%
Linux: (sudo) python display_status.py ;echo $?

-------------
REVISIONS
-------------
v.1.0.7
- included command for smart module status
- TODO - included additional loop for checking on 4x sender card outputs (applicable to MCRTRL6XX)

v1.0.5
- increased timeout from 0.5s to 0.6s (in config.json) to ensure consistent response from sender card
- cleaned and tidied up code, removed commented/unused instructions
- check on presence of multifunction card now accommodates any valid card, not just MFN300(-B)

v1.0.4
- Included Flash module timeout in initial messages (value taken from config.json)
- Amended messaging for easier reading of logs
- Amended output messaging and included EXIT_CODE and message in log

v1.0.3
- Updated module flash checks to reflect ACK/STATUS bytes when a module flash is not detected. Does not necessarily indicate an error if Flash not present on module. Needs further checks and tests. 
- Included checks for when a MFN-300 is connected (use of ambient light sensor for example on MCTRL660 which has no ALS input). If MFN not present, will query ALS via sender directly.
- Included number of expected/found sender and receiver cards in output message

-------------
TO DO
-------------
- (DONE) - Include number of expected/found sender (DONE) and receiver cards (DONE) and modules
- Append text to output message string when multiple anomalies found
- Include overall output (EXIT_CODE and message string) into status.json file
- Include scenario for when modules connected to several sender output ports (e.g. logo boxes)
- display control scripts
    - auto-brightness settings
    - display on/off
    - testing on/off
    - brightness setting (manual)
- EDID: interpret returned data; this may require additional packages.
- Define testing regime, criteria, methodology
- clear up code in methods.py
- include check on global brightness - this should be >0 (except at night time) so should raise a WARNING
- potentially compare global brightness vs ALS reading to ensure display is sufficiently bright
- find suitable name for application (LEDManager, NovaMan, other?) and amend where relevant

-------------
COMPATIBILITY
-------------

Please note that for certain parameters and features, i.e. the Module Flash and the Ribbon Cable checks, the LED cabinets must have the adequate hardware and the receiver the adequate firmware.
For legacy equipment, this is not guaranteed and the result may be unkown. The other parameters are generally valid.

    Logs activity whereby the state of the display is changed (e.g. display ON/OFF).
- debug.log
    Logs information useful for troubleshooting, debugging and testing. Mainly records serial commands sent and the corresponding data received.
- config.json
    JSON file used to store application configuration data such as:
        - version: current version of the suite
        - baudrate: used for serial communications (different sender cards used different baudrate)
        - sleep time: used to pause between transmission/reception of serial commands 
- display_status.py

- methods.py
    PYTHON script which contains additional functions used in the various scripts.
- status.json
    JSON file summarising the information retrieve from the Novsatar sender and receiver cards.


Additionally, the following files may be used for managing the display:
- set_display_on.py
- set_display_off.py
